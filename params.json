{"name":"GTGameEngine","tagline":"A simple game engine written in C++","body":"# GTGameEngine\r\n\r\nGTGameEngine is yet another game engine written in C++. It currently uses OpenGL,\r\nbut it has been designed to (hopefully) allow a D3D implementation relatively easily.\r\n\r\nGTGameEngine supports Windows and Linux and compiles with MSVC, GCC and Clang. Other\r\ncompilers have not been tested, but should mostly work. The Linux build usually lags\r\nbehind the Windows build, so expect some errors with the Linux build occasionally.\r\n\r\nGTGameEngine is built as a static library. There is no direct support for\r\nshared/dynamic libraries (.so/.dll).\r\n\r\nWhile I do appreciate people trying this out, I do ask that you don't yet build\r\nanything serious until things become a bit more stable. In particular, I'm not\r\nyet concerning myself with backwards compatibility with the serialized format\r\nof most objects, so things like model and scene files will probably break quite\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\n\r\nGTGameEngine depends on the following libraries:\r\n\r\n* GTCore (https://github.com/mackron/GTCore)\r\n  * pcre (http://www.pcre.org)\r\n  * Lua (http://www.lua.org)\r\n* GTImage (https://github.com/mackron/GTImage)\r\n  * libpng (http://www.libpng.org)\r\n  * zlib (http://zlib.net)\r\n* GTType (https://github.com/mackron/GTType)\r\n  * FreeType 2 (http://www.freetype.org)\r\n* GTGUI (https://github.com/mackron/GTGUI)\r\n* GTGL (https://github.com/mackron/GTGL)\r\n* GLM (http://glm.g-truc.net)\r\n* Bullet (http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress)\r\n* assimp (http://assimp.sourceforge.net)\r\n* RapidXML (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net)\r\n* Recast+Detour (http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation)\r\n* HACD (http://sourceforge.net/projects/hacd)\r\n* OpenAL (see note below)\r\n\r\n\r\nRapidXML, Recast, Detour and HACD are included in the engine's source tree, so there\r\nis no need to build these manually. Licences are below.\r\n\r\nFor audio we use OpenAL. We use OpenAL Soft (http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html)\r\nas our OpenAL implementation, but you should be able to use the implementation from\r\nCreative just fine. We supply pre-built binaries of the OpenAL Soft implementation in\r\nthe 'external' directory, but not every configuration is included. It would probably\r\nbe best to build your own to match your own configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Licencing\r\n\r\nGTGameEngine is licenced under the MIT licence:\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 David Reid\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
