0.0.2 ()

BREAKING CHANGES:
    - The serialized format of Dynamics and Proximity components has changed.
      Any scenes with scene nodes using Dynamics and Proximity components are
      now invalid and will crash on load.
    - The .gtmodel file format has changed. All .gtmodel files need to be
      deleted to allow the engine to re-create them.
      

FEATURES:
    - If a scene is playing inside the scene editor, it will be paused when the
      main window loses focus.
    - Added a "Viewport" menu to the particle editor.
          - Allow the user to change the orientation of the preview particle
            system.
          - Allow the user to show/hide the grid and axis arrows.
          - Allow the user to reset the camera
    - Material channels are no longer pre-defined. This means materials can
      more easily be used by custom renderers.
    - Bones can now have their absolute position, rotation and scale set via
      both C++ and Lua.
    - The way materials are set in the model editor has been changed. The new
      system allows the user to easily set default values for material uniforms
      to be used by the model.
    - Wireframes are now displayed for all collision shapes in Dynamics and
      Proximity components.
    
    
FIXES/IMPROVEMENTS:
    - Fixed a prefab updating bug (issue #59).
    - Fixed a memory leak.
    - Partly fixed a script compilation issue (issue #45).
    - Fixed a bug where the mouse would sometimes not be released when playing
      a scene from inside the scene editor.
    - Fixed an animation looping bug.
    - Fixed a bad bug where keyboard shortcuts would be handled by all open
      scenes instead of only the currently focused one.
    - Fixed a heap of bugs with collision shapes.
    - Internal cleanup of the editor code.
    - Update a few minor things with the sandbox, mostly with the intro scene.
    - A small, barely noticeable optimization to the default renderer.
