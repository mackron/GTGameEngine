0.0.3 ()

BREAKING CHANGES:
    - None


FEATURES:
    - Added an OpenGL 2.1 renderer and dropped the OpenGL 3.3 one. The plan for
      the future is to have a "legacy" renderer which is OpenGL 2.1 and a
      "default" renderer which is OpenGL 4.4 based. OpenGL 3.3 does not add
      anything worth justifying it's own code path.
    - Added the ability to control whether or not mouse smoothing is enabled.
    - Added the ability to set the shape of dynamics and proximity components
      to the convex hulls of the model defined in the model component, if any.
    - Added navigation mesh integration into the scene editor.
    - Added support for controlling the translation snapping size in the scene
      editor.
    - Added support for setting collision groups to dynamics and proximity
      components from the editor and scripting environment.
    - Added support for callbacks to ray-tests performed through the scripting
      environment.
    - Added the ability to filter events that are dispatched by the game. This
      allows games and parts of the engine itself to modify the event inputs
      and to also prevent events from getting dispatched at all.
    - Added the ability to delete files and folders from the data explorer in
      the editor.


FIXES/IMPROVEMENTS:
    - Fixed a bug where the wireframes for collision shapes in Dynamics and
      Proximity components would not show up.
    - Fixed a few Linux issues, but still a bit of work to go, especially with
      the clipboard/copy+paste.
    - Fixed a GUI bug where deleted style attributes would not be handled
      correctly.
    - Fixed a transparency bug.
    - Fixed an OpenGL rendering error message.
    - Fixed an issue where HDR was prohibitively slow on Intel GPUs.
    - Fixed a bug where material parameters were not getting set correctly.
    - Fixed a bug where materials would sometimes use incorrect textures.
    - Fixed a crash when closing a scene from the editor while it was playing.
    - Fixed a bug where physics objects were not getting added to the world
      when the owner scene node had a parent.
    - Fixed an issue where doing Game.Pause() and Game.Resume() would not work
      as expected when playing a scene from inside the editor.
    - Fixed an issue with loading images in the GUI when it is not found in the
      highest priority path.
    - Fixed an issue where every GUI element would receive the keyboard focus
      when it was clicked on by the mouse.
    - Fixed an issue where the scrollbar in multi-line text boxes would not
      update when vertically scrolling while selecting text.
    - Sounds now use the search paths when loading.
    - Back faces are no longer selected in the scene editor.
    - Detaching a scene node from it's prefab now creates an undo/redo point.
    - Prefabs are now automatically updated when a scene node that is linked to
      it is changed.
    - Optimizations and improvements to font loading.
        - Fonts now load based on those installed on the system.
        - The data/engine/fonts directory has been removed.
        - The Windows build no longer depends on FreeType.
    - Optimizations to the GUI system, mostly with loading. A lot of work still
      to go here.
    - Removed default-1x1.dae and sphere.dae from the repository.
        - Changed the default mesh for cubes to default.dae.
    - When creating an asset from inside the editor, it will be expanded and
      selected in the data explorer.
    - More work on documentation
        - Tips, Tricks and Quirks
        - GUI Styling
        - OpenGL Notes

0.0.2 (July 8th, 2013)

BREAKING CHANGES:
    - The serialized format of Dynamics and Proximity components has changed.
      Any scenes with scene nodes using Dynamics and Proximity components are
      now invalid and will crash on load.
    - The .gtmodel file format has changed. All .gtmodel files need to be
      deleted to allow the engine to re-create them.
      

FEATURES:
    - If a scene is playing inside the scene editor, it will be paused when the
      main window loses focus.
    - Added a "Viewport" menu to the particle editor.
        - Allow the user to change the orientation of the preview particle
          system.
        - Allow the user to show/hide the grid and axis arrows.
        - Allow the user to reset the camera
    - Material channels are no longer pre-defined. This means materials can
      more easily be used by custom renderers.
    - Bones can now have their absolute position, rotation and scale set via
      both C++ and Lua.
    - The way materials are set in the model editor has been changed. The new
      system allows the user to easily set default values for material uniforms
      to be used by the model.
    - Wireframes are now displayed for all collision shapes in Dynamics and
      Proximity components.
    
    
FIXES/IMPROVEMENTS:
    - Fixed a prefab updating bug (issue #59).
    - Fixed a memory leak.
    - Partly fixed a script compilation issue (issue #45).
    - Fixed a bug where the mouse would sometimes not be released when playing
      a scene from inside the scene editor.
    - Fixed an animation looping bug.
    - Fixed a bad bug where keyboard shortcuts would be handled by all open
      scenes instead of only the currently focused one.
    - Fixed a heap of bugs with collision shapes.
    - Internal cleanup of the editor code.
    - Update a few minor things with the sandbox, mostly with the intro scene.
    - A small, barely noticeable optimization to the default renderer.
    - Sprites and direction arrows are now hidden when playing a scene from
      inside the scene editor.
    - More work on documentation.
        - Hello, World! and GUI Basics tutorials.
        - Known Limitations
        - Supported File Formats
