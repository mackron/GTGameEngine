#About
This is an experimental library containing implementations of common space partitioning data structures such as
quadtrees and octrees.

The main reason I'm building this library is to get a better understanding of how these data structures work
and figure where each one is best used for various purposes. Maybe at some point this will stabilize to the
point that it's usable in a production environment, but for now you best not use this if you happen to have
stumbled across it.
