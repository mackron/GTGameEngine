        <h1>GTGameEngine</h1>

<p>GTGameEngine is yet another game engine written in C++. It currently uses OpenGL,
but it has been designed to (hopefully) allow a D3D implementation relatively easily.</p>

<p>GTGameEngine supports Windows and Linux and compiles with MSVC, GCC and Clang. Other
compilers have not been tested, but should mostly work. The Linux build usually lags
behind the Windows build, so expect some errors with the Linux build occasionally.</p>

<p>GTGameEngine is built as a static library. There is no direct support for
shared/dynamic libraries (.so/.dll).</p>

<p>While I do appreciate people trying this out, I do ask that you don't yet build
anything serious until things become a bit more stable. In particular, I'm not
yet concerning myself with backwards compatibility with the serialized format
of most objects, so things like model and scene files will probably break quite
frequently.</p>

<p>GTGameEngine depends on the following libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li>GTCore (<a href="https://github.com/mackron/GTCore">https://github.com/mackron/GTCore</a>)

<ul>
<li>pcre (<a href="http://www.pcre.org">http://www.pcre.org</a>)</li>
<li>Lua (<a href="http://www.lua.org">http://www.lua.org</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GTImage (<a href="https://github.com/mackron/GTImage">https://github.com/mackron/GTImage</a>)

<ul>
<li>libpng (<a href="http://www.libpng.org">http://www.libpng.org</a>)</li>
<li>zlib (<a href="http://zlib.net">http://zlib.net</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GTType (<a href="https://github.com/mackron/GTType">https://github.com/mackron/GTType</a>)

<ul>
<li>FreeType 2 (<a href="http://www.freetype.org">http://www.freetype.org</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>GTGUI (<a href="https://github.com/mackron/GTGUI">https://github.com/mackron/GTGUI</a>)</li>
<li>GTGL (<a href="https://github.com/mackron/GTGL">https://github.com/mackron/GTGL</a>)</li>
<li>GLM (<a href="http://glm.g-truc.net">http://glm.g-truc.net</a>)</li>
<li>Bullet (<a href="http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress">http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress</a>)</li>
<li>assimp (<a href="http://assimp.sourceforge.net">http://assimp.sourceforge.net</a>)</li>
<li>RapidXML (<a href="http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net">http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net</a>)</li>
<li>Recast+Detour (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation">http://code.google.com/p/recastnavigation</a>)</li>
<li>HACD (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hacd">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hacd</a>)</li>
<li>OpenAL (see note below)</li>
</ul><p>RapidXML, Recast, Detour and HACD are included in the engine's source tree, so there
is no need to build these manually. Licences are below.</p>

<p>For audio we use OpenAL. We use OpenAL Soft (<a href="http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html">http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html</a>)
as our OpenAL implementation, but you should be able to use the implementation from
Creative just fine. We supply pre-built binaries of the OpenAL Soft implementation in
the 'external' directory, but not every configuration is included. It would probably
be best to build your own to match your own configuration.</p>
