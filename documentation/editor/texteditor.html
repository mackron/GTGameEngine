        The text editor can be used for general text editing, but it's main purpose is to integrate script editing directly into the editor.
        </p>
        <p>
        Below is a screenshot of the text editor showing a script file:
        </p>
        <div class="documentation-img-container">
            <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/documentation/editor/text-editor-1.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/documentation/editor/text-editor-1.png" width="700" title="GTGameEngine Text Editor"/></a>
        </div>
        <p>
        Scripts will do a compilation whenever the file is saved. Errors will appear in the <b>Error List</b> on the bottom. Unfortunately most
        scripting errors are actually runtime errors because of the dynamic nature of Lua. Runtime errors do not currently appear in the error
        list, but is planned for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
        A very important thing to note here is that the compilation of a script is not yet done a 100% fully self contained environment. Calling a
        function in global space will cause that function to actually execute during the compilation step. Some functions might actually modify
        some of the game and engine state. This issue should hopefully be fixed soon.
