            The editor is built into every GTGameEngine game. There is no need for a separate editor executable, but it is perfectly
            acceptable if it suits your development pipeline. When the editor is opened, the main game is paused, but still active
            in the background. The default shortcut for toggling the editor is Shift+TAB.
        </p>
        <p>
            The editor is essentially a container for sub-editors. There is a sub-editor for most types of assets. Below is a screenshot
            with a few assets opened:
        </p>
        <div style="margin-left:60px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px">
            <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7oAqX3T.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7oAqX3T.png" width="700" title="GTGameEngine Editor"/></a>
        </div>
        <p>
            In the image above, we have two assets open: a model called "default.dae" and the sandbox intro scene called "intro.gtscene".
            You can switch between assets by just cycling between their tabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The panel on the left lists all of the assets in the data directories. This will automatically update when a change is made
            to the file system. For example, when you create a new model, you just drop it into the file system and the editor will
            automatically pick it up.
        </p>
        <p>
            The tool bar along the very top will change depending on the asset that is currently showing. However, some items on the tool
            bar will be constant across all assets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The bar along the bottom is currently only used for the command prompt. This will change in the future and will probably become
            something more of a utility bar for error notifications, a command propt, etc. The command prompt is simply a place for you to
            call scripting functions which will run on the game's scripting environment.
        </p>

            The main part of the editor are the sub-editors. there is a sub-editor for each type of asset. The reference pages below will
            go into more detail for each editor type.
