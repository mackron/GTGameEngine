            The scene editor is the most important editor and is used to create scenes/levels/maps. GUI's are also handled in the scene
            editor which will be explained later. Below is a screenshot of the scene editor. Specifically, it is a screenshot of the
            main editor with a scene asset open and active.

            The two main parts of the scene editor are the viewport and the properties panel on the right. There is currently only a
            single viewport (no orthograpic top/side/front views). The panel on the right has several tabs which will be explained later.

            <h1>Workflow</h1>
            <p>
            To build a scene, you place scene nodes into the scene and then attach components to those scene noes to define their behaviour
            and appearance.
            </p>
            <p>
            To add a scene node:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Right-click in the viewport or</li>
                <li>Drag a model from the asset explorer or</li>
                <li>Drag a prefab from the asset explorer or</li>
                <li>Duplicate an existing scene node (<b>CTRL+D</b> while selected)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Use <b>Delete</b> to delete selected scene nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
            To add a component, select the scene node and hit the "New Component" button in the Properties panel (right-hand side). Below
            is a quick reference on the different engine-defined prefabs:
            </p>
            <table class="shortcuts-table">
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Model</b></td><td>Give the scene node a model/mesh</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Ambient Light</b></td><td>Have the scene node cast an ambient light</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Directional Light</b></td><td>Have the scene node cast a directional light</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Point Light</b></td><td>Have the scene node cast a point light</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Dynamics</b></td><td>Have the scene node interact with physics (both dynamic and static)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Proximity</b></td><td>Have the scene node be able to detect when other scene nodes enter it's proximity</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Script</b></td><td>Give the scene node the ability to execute scripts in response to events posted by the engine</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Camera</b></td><td>Allow the scene node to be used as a camera</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Particle System</b></td><td>Give the scene node a particle system</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
            When a component is added to a scene node, a properties group box will be added to the scene node's properties panel. It should be
            simple enough to understand the meaning of the properties of a component.
            </p>
            <p>
            The scene editor also supports prefabs which are basically just templates to make reusability easier. A dedicated section for
            prefabs can be found further down on this page.
            </p>
            <p>
            Use the <i>Hierarchy</i> panel (right-side panel) to modify the parent/child relationship of scene nodes. Use drag-and-drop and the
            right-click context menu.
            </p>

            <h1>Viewport</h1>
            <p>
            There is currently only a single viewport (no orthograpic top/side/front views). Below is a quick reference on the controls:
            </p>
            <table class="shortcuts-table">
                <tr>
                    <td><b>LMB + Move Up/Down</b></td><td>Move camera forward/backward</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>LMB + Move Left/Right</b></td><td>Turn camera left/right</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>RMB + Move</b></td><td>Turn camera</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>LMB + RMB + Move</b></td><td>Pan camera</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>LMB (No Move)</b></td><td>Select</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>RMB (No Move)</b></td><td>Context Menu</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
            To move, rotate or scale a scene node you need to use the transformation handles that show when the scene node is selected.
            You can switch between translate, rotate and scale modes and also global and local modes.
            </p>
            <table class="shortcuts-table">
                <tr>
                    <td><b>T, R, S</b></td><td>Translate, Rotate, Scale transform modes, respectively</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>G, L</b></td><td>Global, Local transform modes, respectively</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>Q</b></td><td>Toggle between Global and Local transform modes</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><b>CTRL</b></td><td>Snap while translating (no current support for snapping rotation and scale)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>
            The <i>Viewport</i> menu on the toolbar can be used to control some properites of the viewport.
            </p>

        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Panel</h1>
            <p>
            The right-side panel is where various properties are modified.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <b>Properties</b> tab is where the properties of the selected scene node are viewed and modified. Unfortunately there is not
            currently support for viewing/modifying common properties of multiple scene nodes at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <b>Hierarchy</b> tab is where the parent/child relationships of scene nodes are handled. It also allows you to do miscellaneous
            stuff such as selecting and deleting scene nodes. There is not currently any search functionality here, but it is planed for the
            future.
            </p>
            <p>
            Scene nodes that are linked to a prefab will be highlighted blue in the hierarchy panel. You can unlink a scene node from a prefab
            from the hierarchy by right-clicking on the scene node and selecting "Unlink from Prefab".
            </p>
            <p>
            The <b>Scene Properties</b> tab is where various properties of the scene itself can be modified. This is currently very bare bones
            and only includes a few properties. Currently, you can only modify the name (not the file name) and a very limited number of
            rendering properties.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Prefabs</h1>
            <p>
            A prefab can be thought of as a template for creating and updating scene nodes. When a scene node is linked to a prefab, it will be
            updated when the prefab is updated.
            </p>
            <p>
            Prefabs are created from a source scene node. The definition of a prefab is stored in a file which can be reused across multiple
            scenes. A prefab can only be created and updated via a scene editor.
            </p>
            <p>
            To create a prefab, first create a new prefab file by right-clicking on a folder in the asset explorer and choosing "New Prefab".
            Do not include the .gtprefab extension when specifying the file name. After the file is created, you drag the source scene node
            from the <i>Hierarchy</i> panel onto the prefab file in the asset explorer. This will automatically link the source node to the
            newly update prefab.
            </p>
            <p>
            To instantiate a prefab, you simple drag it from the asset explorer into the scene. This will place it just in front of the
            camera. Watch out for perspective illusions - it often feels like a scene node can appear closer or further away than it actually
            is.
