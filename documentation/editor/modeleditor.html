        The model editor can be used to modify some simple properties of a model. It does not let you edit the actual geometric data or animations, but
        it does let you modify some engine-specific properties such as animation segments and convex decomposition.
        </p>

        Below is a screenshot of the model editor:

        </div>
        <p>
        The viewport has the same movement controls as the scene editor:
        </p>
        <table class="shortcuts-table">
            <tr>
                <td><b>LMB + Move Up/Down</b></td><td>Move camera forward/backward</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>LMB + Move Left/Right</b></td><td>Turn camera left/right</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>RMB + Move</b></td><td>Turn camera</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>LMB + RMB + Move</b></td><td>Pan camera</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
        To open a model in the editor, all you need to do is make sure the file exists in the game's data directory - the editor will automatically pick
        it up and list it in the asset explorer.
        </p>
        <p>
        The engine will transparently convert the source model to it's own native format. This native model will have the same name and path as the source
        model, except that it will have the ".gtmodel" extension. For example, a source model called "default.dae" (a COLLADA file) will have an associated
        native model in the same directory called "default.dae.gtmodel". You will rarely need to concern yourself with .gtmodel files because the engine
        will handle everything in the background, but it is still important to know how properties are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
        When changing properties in the model editor, you are actually editing the native .gtmodel file. The engine will maintain these properties even
        after modifying the source file. If the .gtmodel file is deleted, the properties will need to be re-set. Think of the .gtmodel file as metadata.
        </p>
        <p>
        The right-side panel contains the properties that can be modified.

            <h1>Meshes</h1>
            <div class="documentation-img-container">
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/documentation/editor/model-editor-meshes-1.png" title="GTGameEngine Model Editor" style="margin-right:16px;" />
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/documentation/editor/model-editor-meshes-2.png" title="GTGameEngine Model Editor" />
            </div>
            <p>
            A model is made up of a number of meshes. Each mesh is just a piece of geometry with a material and skinning information. Meshes are listed in
            the <b>Meshes</b> group box. To set the material of a mesh, just click the mesh in the mesh list and drag-and-drop a material file into the
            "Material" text box.
            </p>
            <p>
            Every material has a set of publicly visible variables (uniform variables) that can be changed at any point. A model can define a set of default
            values that differ from those defined by the material itself. These will be displayed underneath the "Material" text box when a mesh is selected
            from the mesh list. What this system allows is for a game to have a small set of generic materials, with developers only needing to update some
            basic variables without having to dig into the material editor for every single model.
            </p>

        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Bones</h1>
            <div class="documentation-img-container">
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/documentation/editor/model-editor-bones.png" title="GTGameEngine Model Editor" />
            </div>
            <p>
            The bones of the model are listed in a tree-view under the <b>Bones</b> group box. Selecting a bone does not currently do anything, but it's planned
            for the future to actually show the bones in the viewport. The main purpose of this for the time being is to allow developers to easily see the name
            of bones so they can do things like attach a scene node to a bone, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <b>Bones</b> group box will only be shown if the model contains bones.
            </p>

            <h1>Animations</h1>
            <div class="documentation-img-container">
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/documentation/editor/model-editor-animation-segments.png" title="GTGameEngine Model Editor" />
            </div>
            <p>
            You can give a name to a range of animation key frames. Use the <b>Animation Segments</b> panel to create or delete these. Animation segments will be
            used when playing an animation from within the scripting or C++ environment. When an animation segment is played, use the playback controls at the
            bottom to stop playback.
            </p>
            <p>
            The <b>Animation Segments</b> group box will only be shown if the model has an animation track.
            </p>
            <p>
            The bottom panel with the playback controls is a work-in-progress animation timeline. Ignore this for now.
            </p>

            <h1>Convex Decomposition</h1>
            <div class="documentation-img-container">
                <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/documentation/editor/model-editor-cd.png" title="GTGameEngine Model Editor" />
            </div>
            <p>
            The engine can do a convex decomposition (thanks to HACD) of the model. To do this, use the <b>Convex Decomposition</b> group box. Be aware that
            this can take a long time, so don't be alarmed if the editor seems to freeze for a long time.
