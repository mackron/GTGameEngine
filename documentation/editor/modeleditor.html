        The model editor can be used to modify some simple properties of a model. It does not let you edit the actual geometric data or animations, but
        it does let you modify some engine-specific properties such as animation segments and convex decomposition.
        </p>

        Below is a screenshot of the model editor showing the default cube model:

        The viewport has the same movement controls as the scene editor:
        </p>
        <table class="shortcuts-table">
            <tr>
                <td><b>LMB + Move Up/Down</b></td><td>Move camera forward/backward</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>LMB + Move Left/Right</b></td><td>Turn camera left/right</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>RMB + Move</b></td><td>Turn camera</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>LMB + RMB + Move</b></td><td>Pan camera</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
        To open a model in the editor, all you need to do is make sure the file exists in the game's data directory - the editor will automatically pick
        it up and list it in the asset explorer.
        </p>
        <p>
        The engine will transparently convert the source model to it's own native format. This native model will have the same name and path as the source
        model, except that it will have the ".gtmodel" extension. For example, a source model called "default.dae" (a COLLADA file) will have an associated
        native model in the same directory called "default.dae.gtmodel". You will rarely need to concern yourself with .gtmodel files because the engine
        will handle everything in the background, but it is still important to know how properties are saved.
        </p>
        <p>
        When changing properties in the model editor, you are actually editing the native .gtmodel file. The engine will maintain these properties even
        after modifying the source file.
        </p>

        The right-side panel contains the properties that can be modified.
        </p>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Materials</h1>
            <p>
            Materials can be set in the <b>Materials</b> group box. To set a material, either type the relative path or just drag a material from the asset
            explorer (left-side panel). Note that specifying a texture will <b>not</b> work. You must specify a material.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Animations</h1>
            <p>
            You can give a name to a range of animation key frames. Use the <b>Animation Segments</b> panel to create or delete these. Animation segments will be
            used when playing an animation from within the scripting or C++ environment. When an animation segment is played, use the playback controls at the
            bottom to stop playback.
            </p>
            <p>
            The bottom panel with the playback controls is a work-in-progress animation timeline. Ignore this for now.
            </p>

        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Convex Decomposition</h1>
            <p>
            The engine can do a convex decomposition (thanks to HACD) of the model. To do this, use the <b>Convex Decomposition</b> group box. Be aware that
            this can take a long time, so don't be alarmed if the editor seems to freeze for a long time.
