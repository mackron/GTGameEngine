        <p>
        GTGameEngine is still very young. This page lists some known limitations. For the most part this will list only the most major limitations. For
        general bugs and issues, check the <a href="https://github.com/mackron/GTGameEngine/issues?state=open">GitHub Issues page</a>. Every issue listed
        here is planned to be addressed in the future, but are usually longer-term.
        </p>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Documentation</h1>
            <p>
            Documentation, in particular the C++ and Lua references, are extremely lacking. Work on this continues, but there is a lot to do. Future plans
            are to add an in-editor reference feature where the C++ and Lua references are available from inside the editor without needing to go to the
            reference website.
            </p>
            <p>
            A "reference editor" will be added to the main editor which will allow users to create and modify reference files. A tool will then convert the
            reference files to HTML for online access.
            </p>

            <h1>Backwards Compatibility</h1>
            <p>
            There is currently no effort being put into backwards compatibility. Backwards compatibility will probably begin when version 0.1.0 is released or
            when there is enough demand.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Networking</h1>
            <p>
            There is currently no networking functionality whatsoever. This is the biggest major feature missing from the engine right now.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Performance</h1>
            <p>
            No real-world or stress testing has yet been performed on the engine, so there is most likely quite a few lingering performance and efficiency issue
            still needing to be ironed out.
            </p>
            <p>
            Of particular note, rendering performance and memory consumption are most likely the biggest issues.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>File Formats</h1>
            <p>
            There aren't many supported file formats for images, models and sounds. There are plans for adding more formats, but there are no plans on
            adding redundant formats that don't solve a problem already solved by an already-supported format. For example, it's unlikely the engine will
            add MP3 support because OGG (which is planned) already serves the same purpose.
            </p>

        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Scripting</h1>
            <p>
            There is a lot of functionality not yet exposed to the scripting environment. This is an ongoing issue that is constantly being worked on.
            </p>
            <p>
            Support for debugging scripts is virtually non-existant. The future plans are to incorporate debugging directly into the main editor, with all
            of the normal debugging functionality you would expect such as call stack and variable inspection, break-points, etc.
            </p>

        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Particle Systems</h1>
            <p>
            Currently, particle systems are very bare-bones. Of particular note, there are not many emission shape and function options available.
            </p>
            <p>
            Future plans include:
            <ul>
                <li>Spline based interpolation curves for behavioural functions</li>
                <li>GPU accelerated particles</li>
                <li>Physics based particles</li>
                <li>Level of detail</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>Physics Constraints</h1>
            <p>
            There is currently no support for setting up constraints between physics objects via the scene editor or even the scripting environment. This
            is a major issue that will be fixed fairly soon.
