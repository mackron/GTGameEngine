        The purpose of this tutorial is to get you started with creating and working with GUIs in the engine. If you haven't done so yet, go ahead
        and read the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/documentation/tutorials/helloworld">first tutorial</a>. This tutorial will assume you know the
        absolute basics like creating a scene and scene nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
        We'll be creating a main menu which will have "Start Game", "Open Editor" and "Exit to Desktop" buttons. The "Start Game" button will
        simply load an empty scene - it's intended only to show you how to load and start a scene from another scene. We are not concerning
        ourselves with making the GUI look pretty.
        </p>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>0. How it Works</h1>
            <p>
            There is one particular detail about how the engine handles GUIs that you must be aware of - the engine has a single, shared GUI
            environment for the entire game, including the editor. What this means, is that whenever a GUI element is created, it will linger
            around until it's deleted. This is especially important when playing scenes from inside the editor.
            </p>
            <p>
            Another detail is that GUIs are just part of a scene like anything else. You will probably have "GUI" scene nodes in the scene. For
            example, your HUD will probably be represented with a scene node.
            </p>
            <p>
            GUI's are created via the scripting environment. You attach a script to a scene node and create the GUI elements in OnStartup() and
            delete them in OnShutdown(). GUI elements <b><i>must</i></b> be deleted, usually in OnShutdown().
            </p>
            <p>
            GUIs work in a similar way to websites. When you create the element, you attach any number of CSS-like style classes for positioning
            and styling. The style classes are written in a CSS-like language and can be loaded from files.
            </p>

            <h1>1. Get the Sandbox</h1>
            <p>
            As usual, if you haven't yet done so, go grab yourself (hehe) a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/download" target="_blank">copy of the sandbox</a>.
            If you've already got a copy of the sandbox lying around somewhere (such as from the previous tutorial), go ahead and used that
            instead if you like.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>2. Setup the Scene</h1>
            <p>
            First, go ahead and create a new empty scene in any location you like. Then, create an empty node. You'll notice that the new node
            has no visual representation. To make things a bit easier, you can assign a sprite to the node by expanding the <b>Editor Metadata</b>
            panel, checking the <b>Show Sprite</b> check box, and then drag-and-dropping a texture (not a material!) into the text box. Use
            "engine/editor/images/gui-sprite.png" for a sprite that shows the words "GUI" on it.
            </p>
            <p>
            GUIs are handled via the scripting environment. So go ahead and attach a <b>Script</b> component to your GUI node. While you're at
            it, you might as well create an empty script file and drag-and-drop it into the Script component. Call the script file whatever you
            want, but we'll call it "main-menu.lua".
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>3. Write the Script</h1>
            <p>
            The best way for you to learn how to create a GUI is with an example. Put this script into your "main-menu.lua" script file:
            </p>
<pre>
function self:OnStartup()
end

function self:OnShutdown()
end
</pre>
            <p>
            You might have noticed that the script tried to load a style script called "main-menu.style". Go ahead and create that file and
            place this code into it:
            </p>
<pre>
main-menu
{
}
</pre>
            <p>
            If you're familiar with web development (I mean, come on, who isn't?), you'll notice that the styling is very similar to CSS. But
            don't expect it to be exactly the same. The main thing of note is that a normal style class is not prefixed with a period. Also,
            handling the layout of elements is a fair bit different (and better).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>4. Create the Game Scene</h1>
            <p>
            When we hit the "Start Game" button, we want to load another scene. Go ahead and create an empty scene called "game.gtscene" (don't
            include the extension when creating it). You can leave this scene empty if you like.
            </p>
            <p>
            A real game will have an in-game menu like a pause menu, score screen, HUD, etc. You can easily do this in the same way as the main
            menu. Elements can have transparent backgrounds with the "opacity" style attribute (the value is a float between 0 and 1). We'll
            leave this as an exercise for you to figure out.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="documentation-section">
            <h1>5. Test</h1>
            <p>
            Now go ahead an test the main menu scene by playing it from within the editor. When you hit the "Start Game" button, it should load
            up the main game scene in a new tab and automatically play it.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a little side note, if you notice that after you stop playing the scene the GUI elements remain in the viewport, it means you
            haven't deleted them. Remember, you <b><i>must</i></b> delete your GUI elements!
            </p>

            <h1>6. Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
            The purpose of this little "tutorial" was to show the absolute basics of the workflow for creating GUIs in your game. Obviously
            there is a lot more to explain, but having a basic idea on things should make moving forward a bit easier.
            </p>
            <p>
            The main takeaway from this is to remember that all GUIs are part of the same GUI environment which means you <b><i>must</i></b>
            delete your GUI elements!
